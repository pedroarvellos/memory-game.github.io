# memory-game.github.io

That's a simple exercise to demonstrate good practices at the pure HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (implementing Media Query and Responsivity). Furthermore, this project implements the JavaScript pseudo-class, closures and the "this" concept properly.  This project was developed by me during the Nano Degree Front-End Web Developer course provided by Udacity.
